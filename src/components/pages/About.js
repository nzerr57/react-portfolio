      <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Zerr, and I am currently attending the UNC Charlotte Full-Stack coding bootcamp. I have had
            an interest in learning to code for awhile and am excited to finally have the opportunity to better my
            skills.</p>
        <p>I am originally from Indiana, which is where I attended college at Purdue University. I graduated with a
            degree in management in 2016 and shortly thereafter moved to the Charlotte, NC area. In my free time I enjoy
            woodworking, doing home renovation projects, and playing golf.</p>
